<h1>Sprints & Hurdles C18 - 2019</h1>

<div class="container">

<article>
<p>Cleveland Land Services Sports Division contracted by Yate Town Council to refurbish the Yate track during Summer 2018
 have failed to complete the works in the allotted time and have now missed the weather window to lay the
 track surface (2018 the hottest, driest summer for 40 years!).</p>
<p>Consequence is that we may not have a track until late spring 2019 and scheduling the 2019 Sprints & Hurdles event
 with the uncertainty that is laid upon us is not possible.</p> 
<p>Apologies to all athletes that look forward to this event as a season opener. We are similarly disappointed (understatement) but will
 endeavour to get Sprints & Hurdles scheduled again as soon as we have some
 certainty over the track status.</p>
